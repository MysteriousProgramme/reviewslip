 * What each room needs doing today.
 *
 * Pure: bookings and rooms in, a board out. No database and no network, so the
 * ordering — which is the whole value of this screen — can be tested against
 * made-up days rather than by waiting for a real morning to go wrong.
 *
 * The board is for housekeepers, not for the desk, and that decides what is on
 * it. A housekeeper needs to know which room, what state it is in, what is
 * happening to it today and how many people are coming. They do not need the
 * guest's name, email or phone, and this deliberately does not carry them: the
 * screen is opened with a PIN that a whole shift shares and that gets written
 * on a whiteboard eventually, so the less it can show the better. A name adds
 * nothing to stripping a bed.

/**
 * The jobs, most urgent first.
 *
 * `rank` orders the board. The order is the argument this module is making, so
 * it is worth saying why it is this one:
 *
 *   A turnaround — somebody left this morning and somebody else arrives this
 *   afternoon — is the only job with a deadline attached to it that is not
 *   under anybody's control. It goes first, always, however clean the room
 *   looks, because the cost of it being late is a guest standing in reception.
 *
 *   An arrival into a dirty room is the same problem one step behind.
 *
 *   A departure with nobody following is real work with no deadline; a
 *   stayover is a refresh; a free clean room is nothing at all and sits at the
 *   bottom where it can be skimmed past.
